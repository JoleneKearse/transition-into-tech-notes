# Transition into Tech! Learn to Code, Grow & Succeed

![event image](Transition-into-Tech.png)
These are my, admittedly, poor notes from the 2 hour+ event with **[Danny Thompson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dthompsondev/)**, **[Marc Badrian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-badrian-4ab39413/)**, **[Pamela Wolfe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamela-wolfe-54b93a9/)** & **[James Q Quick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesqquick/)**. The panel shared so many great tips and motivators that it was hard to keep up, but these are the notes I was able to capture.

## How do you stand out?

- **Projects!!!** Use them to stand out, and remember to show them off.
- Apply to jobs when you meet 1/2 the requirements, then show your **passion** and **eagerness** when interacting with them.
- **Volunteer**. Remember that those devs with the ability, donâ€™t always have the right **attitude**.
- Be **inquisitive** and always ask questions.

### How to make tutorial projects stand out

- Can you talk about it?
- Do 3/4/5 extras to make the project your own
- Make it personal
- **Explain your why!** Why did you start the project?
- Use your past professional experience
- Be a **storyteller** - what do you have to offer?
- Be **confident**. This is a **practiced skill**. Craft your story.

## 6 tips to get your first job in tech

1. Have the **technical ability**. Additionally bump up your **problem solving skills**. The coding syntax is a tool to solve the problems!
2. Give yourself the **time to learn**. It's okay to review something 5/6 times to really understand it.
3. **LinkedIn**. Invest time to develop your network. Check out Danny's series.
4. **Portfolio site**. This lets **you** control the info that people are getting. So take the time to deliver it right.
5. **Portfolio projects**. One should solve a problem that you know about. _Example_ - A e-commerce site with the backend to order a product when it gets low.
6. **Resume/CV**. _This was #6 for a reason._ Don't just list the basic duties of your job. Why were you great at it? Share your wins, even the small ones!

## The INTERVIEW

- Be **confident**. Show them _'Why they want you'_ and _'Why should they pick you'_.
- Be prepared to talk about yourself!!!
- Ask details before the interview. How many rounds? What is each round: recruiter, technical, behavioural?
- Research the company. Check out their websites and socials; this is the information they want out there. Work this into the interview to show that you prepared.
- Reach out to present and past employees.
- Ask questions!!! _A stat says 85% of hiring managers won't fire someone who doesn't ask questions._
- A good question to ask from Danny: _What does success look like in 6 months from now?_ This gives you your gameplan.

### Different interview rounds

1. The **recruiter** interview is to check out if your resume/CV is true.
2. **Technical**
   Find out what they will be checking: frontend, backend, full stack? If they are doing **Leetcode**-style questions, practice on the site beforehand. Ask questions before and/or during. Try to be comfortable. For whiteboarding, it will be difficult the first time you do it!
3. **Behavioural**
   You should know your resume backwards and forwards. Be able to talk about it in an interesting and succinct way. Some questions include: _How do you approach learning something new? Talk about a time you failed and how you grew. Talk about someone you worked with..._

Also remember to research which tech stack is in demand in your area!

## Needed non-technical skills

1. Create **content**
   Even tweets and LinkedIn messages count! They show your desire to learn. You can develop and show off your ability to communicate technical skills. This will help you in your career too, because you will be able to speak up in meetings to help, brainstorm and explain things.
   Document your journey publically. This helps others understand how hard the process can be and may even get them into the journey. This will increase your **visibility**.
2. **Communication**
   Important for on the job.

- Relate to your team.
- If what you are doing impacts someone else's work, it's important to talk with them.
- Ask questions so you are on the same page with your team. Don't assume anything.

3. **Problem solving**
   Even puzzles will develop this skill.
4. **_Nice_ confidence**

- Confidence comes from being comfortable.
- To help with that you can prepare talking points. In an **interview**, have 2/3 go-to topics, so you can steer the conversation back to them if/when you get flustered in an interview.
- Have a strong **elevator pitch**
- Remember the interviewing team has only seem your CV or LinkedIn, it's up to you to fill in the blanks.
- Tell them the most important things about yourself early in the interview. This will even get the interview to focus on those points!

## What about that '2 years experience' requirement?

- Remember that this is _only_ a minimum requirement.
- Doing projects can get you the experience and knowledge.
- Think of this requirement as **negotiable**. Think of ways you can mitigate it.
<hr>

## How do you know you're ready to apply?

- **You won't!** Just apply, because you never know what might happen.
- And if a certain language or tool is needed and you don't know it. You can do a crash course to be able to talk about it in general.
- If a job wants 3 years, but you only have 8 months - apply anyway!
- The hiring manager can gauge your progress. Maybe you don't have the years, but you have more exposure through volunteering or projects. These demonstrate passion.
- The listed years might be how long they think their workers would take to get there. It's all relative.
- **But** also check out the job title. If they are asking for a senior dev, a junior or mid won't cut it.
<hr>

## De-risk yourself as a candidate

Companies don't actually need junior devs; they are making an investment in you.
They want to see how you approach problems. In a tech interview, talk a problem out. Let them see your approach.
You can under-perform at a whiteboard task, but over-perform on talking through your process. So you don't necessarily have to solve the issue, but if you talk it through they might be impressed with you.

< _I missed the question the panel was answering_ >

1. time learning v.s. how you can help the company
2. Can you stand out?
3. If given a task, can you do it yourself without hand-holding. Googling is still okay, but can you figure out the logic yourself.
4. Match 50% of the job listing
